# AggregatorCLI

A simple cli tool that aggregates rss feeds and displays the title and description.

You'll need to have [go](https://go.dev/doc/install) and [postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) installed. 

To set up the config file for database and current user, create a json file named 
.gatorconfig.json to your root directory

`~/.gatorconfig.json`
